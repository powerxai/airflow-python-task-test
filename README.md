# Airflow Dynamic DAGs Coding Challenge

## Overview

This is a coding challenge designed to assess how quickly you can understand and navigate a real codebase. The repository contains code for running **dynamic DAGs in Airflow 3.x**.

## Challenge Instructions

- **Time Limit**: You have **15 minutes** to read through the codebase
- **Objective**: Understand what the code does and how it works
- **What's Next**: After your review, you'll be asked questions about the codebase

## Your Task

Use your time wisely. Decide which files are most important to read and which can be skipped. Focus on understanding:
- The overall architecture
- The key components and their relationships
- How dynamic DAGs are generated and configured

Good luck!
